## Tech Stack & Open-Source Libraries
- Architectures & Components
  - MVVM Architecture (Model - View - ViewModel)
  - Repository Pattern
  - ViewModel - Allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
  - LiveData - An observable data holder class.
  - ViewBinding - A feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
  - SwipeRefreshLayout - Implement the swipe-to-refresh UI pattern.
- The Room persistence - Provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
- [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/retrofit) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and the JVM.
- [Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger) - A fast dependency injector for Android and Java.
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide), [GlidePalette](https://github.com/florent37/GlidePalette) - Loading images from network.
- [Material-Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Material design components for building CardView.
- [ProgressView](https://github.com/skydoves/progressview) - A polished and flexible ProgressView, fully customizable with animations.

## Architecture
Pokedex-AR is based on MVVM architecture and a repository pattern.
